# Random-Sentence-Generator

It's a simple random sentence generator as it only takes words from the words.txt file and forms it into a sentences defined in the sentence array, you can even add more sensible sentences to the array but at the end of the day it just selects a random word and adds it to the sentence to form it in a correct way and sometimes incorrect way. I will improve it more over-time, but for now it's working really great and can be used to build a chat-bot or an artificial intelligence bot. 

All you need to do is execute the random.php file from console, you may also add words in the words.txt file. The words.txt file consists of adjectives, nouns and verbs and only one of those words are selected to be used in the sentence.
